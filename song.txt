Everybody sour like a lemon tree
I'm just smiling down upon my enemies
Do this shit, I love it on the daily
You say you hate your job, but you'll never leave, never leave
But that ain't gonna be me, that ain't gonna be me
My brother called me up said he saw me on TV
I said, "it wasn't easy, but right now I'm living breezy."
Build this engine from the ground up, now my hands they ain't so greasy, feel me?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
New chorus
Illuminate my future bright
So thankful for everything
Rejuvenate my inner light
As I work hard for all I need
Open arms, embracing life
And all of which you gave me
Hard work, it pays off
I'm happy now, it's paying me
Close my eyes sometimes it feels as if I go away
I love the life I live and enjoy the ride along the way
"I make a living out of living," yeah, that's what I say
I've got one life to live, and I wouldn't live it no other way
